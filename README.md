## Description
A small todo list app in which you can enter a task into an input field, and submit it to put it into your 'todo list'. This
app includes functionality such as handling button responses, creating/deleting items on the DOM, and oninput events tracking
the number of characters in a field (twitter-like character restriction). The task in the todo list can be marked as complete 
if clicked on, which modifies its appearance. If clicked on accident, the element can be clicked again to undo the completion.
It is created with with HTML/CSS/JS.
